# OpenStreetMap Data Case Study

### Map Area
Phoenix, Arizona, United States

I used to live in Phoenix. I wanted to look back at those places I used to go and to see how much the city, since I have left.


## Problems Encountered in the Map
After downloading file of Phoenix area, I ran smaller.py to get small sample from the file I had just downloaded.
From examining the sample through running a mapparser.py which shows tag elements, I noticed few problems with the data.

1. Inconsistent postal code *("AZ 84032", "85023-254", "AZ 85375 \u200e", "85302")*
2. Inconsistent state name *("Arizona", "AZ")*
3. OverÂ­abbreviated  street names *("Ave", "St")*
4. Inconsistent phone and fax number *("+1 403 948 923", "406 403 305")*


### 1. Inconsistent postal code
I used audit.py to find postal code that are inconsistent and update the code to make postal code consistent. Below is the part of the code from the audit.py

```python
def is_post_code(elem):
    return (elem.tag == "tag") and (elem.attrib['k'] == "addr:postcode")

elif is_post_code(elem):
    m = postal_check.search(elem.attrib['v'])
    if m:
        if "-" in elem.attrib['v']:
            name = elem.attrib['v'].split("-")
            elem.attrib['v'] = name[0]
            return elem.attrib['v']

        else:
            name = elem.attrib['v'].split(" ")
            elem.attrib['v'] = name[1]
            return elem.attrib['v']
    else:
        return elem.attrib['v']

```
This updated all the postal codes, which had abbreviation in the front of the code(AZ 54368) or have more than 5 numbers(54368-345), into just five numbers(54368).

### 2. Inconsistent state name
I used audit.py to find state names that are inconsistent and update the names to make state names consistent. Below is the part of the code from the audit.py

```python
def is_state_name(elem):
    return (elem.tag == "tag") and (elem.attrib['k'] == "addr:state")

elif is_state_name(elem):
    if elem.attrib['v'] == "Arizona":
        elem.attrib['v'] = "AZ"
        return elem.attrib['v']
    else:
        return elem.attrib['v']
```
This updated all the states names, which had full name as Arizona, into abbreviation of state as AZ

### 3. Overabbreviated street name
I used mapparser.py to find overabbreviated street name. Below is the part of the code from the mapparser.py
```python
def count_street(filename):
    tags = {}
    for event, elem in ET.iterparse(filename):
        for sub in elem:
            if sub.tag == "tag":
                if sub.attrib['k'] == "addr:street":
                    if elem.tag in tags:
                        tags[sub.attrib['v']] += 1
                    else:
                        tags[sub.attrib['v']] = 1
    return tags

    mapping = { "St": "Street",
                "St.": "Street",
                "Ave": "Avenue",
                "Rd.": "Road",
                "Blvd.": "Boulevard",
                "RD": "Road",
                "Rd": "Road",
                "Blvd": "Boulevard",
                "Dr": "Drive",
                "Pkwy": "Parkway"
                }
```

I used audit.py to update abbreviated street name into full name. Below is the part of the code from the audit.py

```python
def is_street_name(elem):
    return (elem.tag == "tag") and (elem.attrib['k'] == "addr:street")

    if is_street_name(elem):
        if elem.attrib['v'] not in expected:
            for keys in mapping.keys():
                if keys in elem.attrib['v']:
                    elem.attrib['v'] = re.sub(keys, mapping[keys], elem.attrib['v'])
                    return elem.attrib['v']
            else:
                return elem.attrib['v']
        else:
            return elem.attrib['v']
```
This updated all the street names, which had abbreviation as St, into full name as Street.


### 4. Inconsistent phone and fax number
I used audit.py to find numbers that are inconsistent and update the numbers to become consistent. Below is the part of the code from the audit.py.
```python
def is_phone(elem):
    return (elem.tag == "tag") and (elem.attrib['k'] == "phone")

elif is_phone(elem):
      if "+" in elem.attrib['v']:
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace("+1-", "")
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace("+1 ", "")
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace("+1", "")
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace("1 ", "")
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace("1", "")
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace("+ ", "")
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace("+", "")
#            elem.attrib['v'] = re.sub("+", "", elem.attrib['v'])
          if " " in elem.attrib['v']:
              elem.attrib['v'] = re.sub(" ", "-", elem.attrib['v'])
              return elem.attrib['v']
          else:
              return elem.attrib['v']
      elif "(" in elem.attrib['v']:
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace("(", "")
          elem.attrib['v'] = elem.attrib['v'].replace(")", "")
#            elem.attrib['v'] = re.sub("(", "", elem.attrib['v'])
#            elem.attrib['v'] = re.sub(")", "", elem.attrib['v'])
          if " " in elem.attrib['v']:
              elem.attrib['v'] = re.sub(" ", "-", elem.attrib['v'])
              return elem.attrib['v']
          else:
              return elem.attrib['v']
      elif " " in elem.attrib['v']:
          elem.attrib['v'] = re.sub(" ", "-", elem.attrib['v'])
          return elem.attrib['v']
      else:
          return elem.attrib['v']
```

This updated all the numbers, which had country code or other symbols as + or (), into number without country code and other symbols.

# Data Overview and Additional Ideas
This section contains basic statistics about the dataset, the SQL queries used to gather them, and some additional ideas about the data in context.

### Size of the file
```
phoenix_arizona.osm ......... 687.6 MB
mydb.db .......... 395.7 MB
nodes.csv ............. 254.4 MB
nodes_tags.csv ........ 11.6 MB
ways.csv .............. 23.8 MB
ways_tags.csv ......... 60.5 MB
ways_nodes.cv ......... 85.8 MB  
```  
### Number of Unique users
```sql
select count(distinct uid) from (select uid from nodes union all select uid from ways) un;
```
1485

### Number of Nodes
```sql
select count(*) from nodes;
```
2999366

### Number of Ways
```sql
select count(*) from ways;
```
389536

### Number of shops
```sql
select key, count(*) as num from nodes_tags where key="shop" group by key;
```
shop|1974

### Top five types of shops
```sql
 select value, count(*) as num from nodes_tags where key="shop" group by value order by num desc limit 5;
```
convenience|597
supermarket|191
clothes|143
car_repair|113
mobile_phone|65

### Other ideas about the dataset

```sql
select key, count(*) as num from nodes_tags group by key order by num desc;
```
From looking at the above sql, I could notice some keys need a update, especially "fixme" or "FIXME" keys.

```sql
select type, key, value from nodes_tags where key="FIXME";
```
regular|FIXME|The church is no longer here it is a taco place. The change should be reported to the geonames people.
regular|FIXME|check religion

From looking at the value given above, there is a lot of fields that need to be update. For example, the we should check whether the place is a church or a taco place, and also check the religion of given place.

```sql
select nodes.lat, nodes.lon from nodes, nodes_tags where nodes.id=nodes_tags.id and nodes_tags.value="check religion";
```

33.5059155|-112.0356437
I used sql above to find the latitude and longitude of the place that had "check religion" value.
[http://www.latlong.net/Show-Latitude-Longitude.html](http://www.latlong.net/Show-Latitude-Longitude.html)
I went to above link and inserted the latitude and longitude to find the address.
I used the address to look at street map provided by google map.
However, there wasn't any building related to religion.

```sql
select nodes.timestamp from nodes, nodes_tags where nodes.id=nodes_tags.id and nodes_tags.value="check religion";
```

2014-06-20T04:17:44Z
Maybe there might have been some building related to religion in 2014 but have changed into malls and hospital.

From this I learned that we should check the timestamp or the day it was edited before using the data because the older the dates are there is a more chance of data being inaccurate.
